# Ottergram

This program is an assignment from Big Nerd Ranch's "Front-End Web Development" by Chris Aquino and Todd Gandee.

Ottergram is a simple photo hosting website in which users can display different pictures of otters for other to see. It is only comprised of HTML and CSS, but also utilizes Flexbox.
